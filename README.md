# BoundaryLayer
Boundary layer solver using approximation method for both laminar and turbulent regime, it's coupled with a potential flow solver using Vortex Panel method to perform viscous-inviscid interaction.

The boundary layer approximation methods are:
  1. Thwaites method for Laminar regime.
  2. Karman momentum-integral method for Turbulent regime.
